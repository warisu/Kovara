# Kovara Contract Events Schema

This document defines the on-chain event schema for the Kovara smart contract, enabling indexers to track state changes and engagement signals.

## Event Versioning

All events are currently `v1`. Breaking schema changes will bump the major version and be announced in the changelog.

---

## ProfileSetEvent (v1)

**Topics:**

- `user: Address` (indexed)

**Data:**

- `username: String`

**Emitted by:** `set_profile()`

**Example filter:**

```bash
stellar events --topic-filter 'user' --contract-id <contract-addr>
```

---

## FollowEvent (v1)

**Topics:**

- `follower: Address` (indexed)
- `followee: Address` (indexed)

**Emitted by:** `follow()`

---

## UnfollowEvent (v1)

**Topics:**

- `follower: Address` (indexed)
- `followee: Address` (indexed)

**Emitted by:** `unfollow()`

---

## PostCreatedEvent (v1)

**Topics:**

- `id: u64` (indexed)
- `author: Address` (indexed)

**Emitted by:** `create_post()`

---

## PostDeleted (v1)

**Topics:**

- `post_id: u64` (indexed)
- `author: Address` (indexed)

**Emitted by:** `delete_post()`

---

## LikePostEvent (v1)

**Topics:**

- `user: Address` (indexed)
- `post_id: u64` (indexed)

**Emitted by:** `like_post()`

**Behavior:** Emitted only on the first like; duplicate likes (idempotent calls) do not emit an event.

**Example filter:**

```bash
stellar events --topic-filter 'user,post_id' --contract-id <contract-addr>
```

---

## TipEvent (v1)

**Topics:**

- `tipper: Address` (indexed)
- `post_id: u64` (indexed)

**Data:**

- `amount: i128` (tip amount in smallest units)
- `fee: i128` (fee retained by treasury)

**Emitted by:** `tip()`

---

## PoolDepositEvent (v1)

**Topics:**

- `depositor: Address` (indexed)
- `pool_id: Symbol` (indexed)

**Data:**

- `amount: i128` (deposit amount in smallest units)

**Emitted by:** `pool_deposit()`

**Example filter:**

```bash
stellar events --topic-filter 'pool_id' --data-filter 'amount' --contract-id <contract-addr>
```

---

## PoolWithdrawEvent (v1)

**Topics:**

- `recipient: Address` (indexed)
- `pool_id: Symbol` (indexed)

**Data:**

- `amount: i128` (withdrawal amount in smallest units)

**Emitted by:** `pool_withdraw()`

**Example filter:**

```bash
stellar events --topic-filter 'pool_id' --contract-id <contract-addr>
```

---

## ContractUpgraded (v1)

**Data:**

- `new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>`

**Emitted by:** `upgrade()`

---

## Notes

- All amounts are in the token's smallest unit (usually stroop for Stellar assets).
- Topics enable efficient filtering and indexing; data fields are available but not indexed.
- Indexers should track event versioning and handle schema migrations when major version bumps occur.
